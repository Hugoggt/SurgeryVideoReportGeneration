# Enhancing Surgical Documentation through Multimodal Visual-Temporal Transformers and Generative AI

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

Surgical procedures generate vast amounts of video data, yet extracting meaningful and structured insights from these videos remains a significant challenge. Current surgical documentation primarily relies on manual reporting, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and subject to variability among practitioners. The automatic summarization of surgical videos is crucial for improving procedural documentation, surgical training, and post-operative analysis.

### Proposed Solution

This thesis presents a **multimodal AI-driven approach** for **surgical video report generation** by leveraging **computer vision** and **large language models (LLMs)**. The model follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Video segmentation into clips**
2. **Frame-level feature extraction** using vision transformers
3. **Object detection and classification** of surgical tools, organs, and actions
4. **Frame captioning** to describe detected features
5. **Clip-level summarization** using temporal models
6. **Final structured surgical report generation** using LLMs

This approach ensures that AI can detect key instruments, actions, and critical events, producing detailed and contextually meaningful surgical summaries.

### 1. **Object Detection**
- Detects surgical tools, tissues, and key structures using a **Vision Transformer (ViT)**.
- A multi-label classification approach ensures accurate feature extraction.

### 2. **Frame Captioning**
- Utilizes a **pre-trained transformer-based model** to generate text descriptions for individual frames.
- Fuses detected objects and visual context for improved text generation.

### 3. **Clip-Level Captioning**
- Leverages **Video Vision Transformers (ViViT)** for temporal modeling.
- Aggregates frame-level captions into clip-level summaries.

### 4. **Final Report Generation**
- Uses **GPT-4** to compile structured and coherent surgical reports.
- A custom prompt ensures consistency and readability in generated reports.
